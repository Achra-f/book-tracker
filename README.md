# Book Tracker

Book Tracker is a React app that lets users log in, add, view, edit, and delete books from their personal collection. It connects to a custom backend API to manage and persist book data.

## Features

- User authentication (login & signup)
- Add new books to your collection
- View a list of your added books (with caching and auto-refetching)
- Edit or delete existing books
- Real-time data fetching with React Query (Tanstack Query)
- Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite for build and dev server
- React Router DOM for routing
- Tanstack React Query for data fetching and caching
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for styling
- JWT for authentication handling
- Zod for validation
